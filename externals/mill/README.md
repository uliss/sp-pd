mill - a highly efficient granular synthesizer for Pure data
============================================================

Oldies but goodies. Unmaintained, non-documented, multi-threaded, and optimised solely for speed, this beast can survive with thousands of concurrent grains in real time.

It builds and works out of the box on Mac and Linux. If it ain't broken, don't fix it.
To build, run 'make' in the directory.
